# AWWA C208-17: A Standard for Fabricated Steel Water Pipe Fittings
 
AWWA C208-17 is a standard published by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) that provides formulas for calculating the general minimum requirements for the dimensions of fabricated steel water pipe fittings. It also includes tables and figures that illustrate the dimensions of common fittings such as elbows, tees, reducers, and caps. The standard applies to fittings for steel water transmission and distribution facilities with a nominal pipe size of 4 in. (100 mm) or larger.

The purpose of this standard is to ensure that fabricated steel water pipe fittings are compatible with each other and with the pipe, valves, and other appurtenances used in water systems. The standard also helps to facilitate the design, fabrication, installation, testing, and inspection of these fittings. The standard is intended to supplement the requirements of other AWWA standards and codes that cover steel water pipe and fittings.
 
The standard was first approved by AWWA in 1968 and has been revised several times since then. The latest edition, AWWA C208-17, was approved in June 2017 and became effective in March 2018. It replaces the previous edition, AWWA C208-12, which was published in 2012. The main changes in the 2017 edition include:
 
- Updating references to other standards and codes.
- Adding a new section on definitions.
- Clarifying the scope and applicability of the standard.
- Revising the formulas for calculating fitting dimensions.
- Adding new tables and figures for fitting dimensions.
- Adding a new annex on fabrication tolerances.

The standard is available for purchase from AWWA as a print or PDF document. The price for AWWA members is $98.00 and for non-members is $140.00[^1^]. The standard can also be downloaded for free from some online sources[^2^] [^3^], but these may not be authorized or updated versions.

## Applications of Fabricated Steel Water Pipe Fittings
 
Fabricated steel water pipe fittings are widely used in water transmission and distribution systems for various purposes. Some of the common applications are:

- Connecting pipes of different diameters, angles, or directions.
- Changing the flow direction or velocity of water.
- Dividing or combining water streams.
- Closing or opening water flow.
- Providing access for inspection, maintenance, or repair.
- Attaching valves, meters, pumps, or other devices.

Fabricated steel water pipe fittings can be designed and manufactured to suit different site conditions, such as soil type, pressure, temperature, corrosion, seismic activity, and alignment. They can also be customized to meet specific customer requirements, such as special coatings, linings, or materials.
 
Fabricated steel water pipe fittings are compatible with various types of pipe joints, such as welded, flanged, mechanical, or rubber. The type of joint depends on the pipe material, size, and application. For example, in the case of steel pipe, fittings may be threaded, welded or make use of cut or rolled-groove end pipe and connectors which employ ring-and-cam systems to couple pipes together[^2^]. The connectors are fast and easy to install and eliminate the cost and complexity of other techniques such as welding[^2^].
 
Fabricated steel water pipe fittings are durable and reliable components that can withstand high pressures, temperatures, and loads. They also have good resistance to corrosion, abrasion, and erosion. They can provide long service life and low maintenance costs for water systems.
